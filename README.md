LightWeave is a captivating interactive canvas that responds to your cursor in real time. Inspired by the elegance of flow fields and organic motion, this project creates dynamic visual trails that follow your movements like whispers of light. Whether you're building a personal portfolio or an immersive web experience, LightWeave adds a touch of elegance and interactivity.

## ✨ Features
- Fluid, organic animations powered by particle trails
- Real-time cursor interaction with subtle physics
- Easily customizable for personal or creative use
- Lightweight and fast with vanilla JS and HTML canvas

## 🚀 Try it Out
Simply open `index.html` in your browser and move your mouse around. Watch how the particles come alive in response.

## 🛠 How It Works
The core logic is powered by `aether-flow.js`, which calculates particle positions based on Perlin noise and vector fields. It uses simple physics to simulate smooth, flowing motion that follows the cursor path.

## 📁 File Structure
- `index.html` – basic canvas setup
- `aether-flow.js` – animation logic and rendering
- `README.md` – project overview

## 🎨 Customize It
Tweak particle colors, speed, or blending modes in `aether-flow.js` to create your own style. Great for interactive landing pages, creative coding experiments, or digital art pieces.
